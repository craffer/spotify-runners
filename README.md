# Spotify Runners

This project aims to create a mobile web app that plays music from runner's own Spotify library at the right cadence, making it easy to listen to the music you love, without distracting from your run.

## Development

To install dependencies and get started with development, clone this repo and run `make init`, preferably after you've created a Python virtual environment.

You need a Spotify API key to run this app on your machine. The code is set up using the `spotipy` Python library, which reads your credentials from the environment variables `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET` from your environment â€“ make sure you've exported these variables with the correct values in order to interact with the Spotify API.
