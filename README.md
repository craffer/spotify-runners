# Spotify Runners

This project aims to create a mobile web app that plays music from runner's own Spotify library at the right cadence, making it easy to listen to the music you love, without distracting from your run.

## Development

To install dependencies and get started with development, clone this repo and run `make init`, preferably after you've created a Python virtual environment.
