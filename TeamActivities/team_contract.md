# Team Contract and Contextual Interviews

## Team Contract

We will meet regularly on Mondays, after class.
We will communicate using our iMessage group chat.
We will stay on track by setting reasonable goals with deliverables, and sticking to them.

## Contextual Interviews

Several job roles for our project are people training for running races, casual runners, people who don't currently listen to music while they run, and aspiring runners.
We expect working with the Spotify API/SDK and learning how to develop for mobile to cause problems.
We will deal with problems by staying in constant communication and by being open-minded.
